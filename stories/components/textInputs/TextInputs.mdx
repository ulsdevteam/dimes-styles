# Text Inputs

Allow users to enter short text in a form.

## When to use

Use the text input component when you need to let users enter text that’s no
longer than a single line, such as their name or phone number. If you need to
let users enter longer answers that might span multiple lines, you should use
the textarea component.

## Best practices

- Provide labels and instructions that are clear and concise.
- If specific validation rules are present on a field, provide instructions for
  completing it. For example, "Passwords must contain at least 8 letters and/or numbers.""
- If the text input is a required field include the `aria-required` property indicate
  that it is a required field, and use the validation message for input errors.
