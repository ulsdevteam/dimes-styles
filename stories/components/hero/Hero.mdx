# Hero

A hero is a section of a page which draws attention through the use of large
images and text.

## When to use

Use a hero on the home page of a web site in order to quickly convey to users
the purpose of the site and actions that are available to them there.

## Best practices

If the image in the hero is purely decorative, like a logo, it does not need
alt text in the `img` element. Instead, use `alt=""` to indicate a decorative image.

## Image dimensions
For different image dimensions, specify the `width` and/or `height` values in local CSS using
the `hero__logo img` selector.

<Story of={stories.basic} />

## Colors

We have two seperate hero's, dependent on if the background is white or blue.
