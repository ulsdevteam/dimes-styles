# Card

Cards allow users to quickly browse content of varying types and lengths.

## When to use

Use to display heterogenous content composed of different elements, whose size or
supported actions vary. Allows a collection of multiple data types to be viewed
as a group so that a user can take some action relating to that group.

## Best practices

For accessibility, ensure that card content is placed in the correct reading order.

## Default implementation
The number of card columns can be specified in local CSS using media queries,
with the base styles providing one column that takes up the full width of its container.
For example, for 4 card columns on large screens and 3 columns on medium screens, use:
```
.card-list {
  @include md-up {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }

  @include lg-up {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  }
}
```

By default, cards are designed to be a list of links with a body and a footer.

<Story of={stories.basic} />

However, the card footer is optional.

<Story of={stories.noFooter} />

## Using cards as stylized content containers
A card can be used flexibly as a content container that is not
part of a list or a link by adding the `card--container` class and adjusting
the HTML structure for the desired content. This example includes an `h2`
as the card title:

<Story of={stories.notLink} />
