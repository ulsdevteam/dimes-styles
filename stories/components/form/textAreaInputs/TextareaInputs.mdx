# Textarea Input

Allow users to enter long text in a form.

## When to use

Use a textarea component when you need to let users enter an amount of text
thatâ€™s longer than a single line.

## Best practices

- You must label textareas. Placeholder text is not a suitable substitute for a
  label, as it disappears when users click inside the textarea.
- Make the height of a textarea proportional to the amount of text you expect
  users to enter. You can set the height of a textarea by by specifying the rows
  attribute.
- Users will often need to copy and paste information into a textarea, so do not
  stop them from doing this.
