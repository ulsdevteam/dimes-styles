# Checkbox

A checkbox is an input control that allows a user to select one or more options
from a number of choices.

## When to use

Use a checkbox when you need to help users:
- Select multiple options from a list
- Toggle a single option on or off

Do not use a checkbox if users can only choose one option from a list. In this
case, use radio buttons.

## Best practices

- Checkboxes must have a clear and concise label.
- Users should be warned if selecting a checkbox will cause a change in context.
- If the checkbox is a required field include the aria-required property,
  indicate that it is a required field, and use a validation message for input errors.

## Colors

Checkboxes can come in different colors:

<Story of={stories.colors} />

## Required

When a checkbox input is required, additional styles should be applied:

<Story of={stories.required} />

## Grouping checkboxes

Related checkboxes should be grouped together using a `fieldset`
with a `legend` that describes the group of inputs:

<Story of={stories.groupedCheckboxes} />
