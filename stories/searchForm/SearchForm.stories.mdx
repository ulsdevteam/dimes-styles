# Search

Search enables users to specify a word or a phrase to find relevant pieces of
content without the use of navigation.

## When to use

Search can be used as the primary means of discovering content, or as a filter
to aid the user in finding content.

## Best practices

A page will usually only have one search element. If a page includes more than
one search element, each search field should have a unique label. Placeholders
are not recognized by all assistive technologies, so do not use placeholder
text to replace labels.

## Known issues

No known issues.

## Basic implementation

<Story story={stories.basic} />

## With additional controls

It is possible to add additional controls to the search component. These can
either be set off as a separate block element:

<Story story={stories.withBlockControls} />

Or included as an inline element:

<Story story={stories.withInlineControls} />

## Hiding elements

It is possible to hide the label for the search input by adding the `visually-hidden` class:

<Story story={stories.noLabel} />

In cases where a search is automatically executed on keydown or other event, the
search input button can be hidden as well:

<Story story={stories.noButton} />
